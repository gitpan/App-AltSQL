Install System Wide:
====================

Installing altsql system side is best done with the `cpan` tool you probably already have installed on your machine.

  $ sudo cpan

  cpan[1]> install App::AltSQL

If you don't have cpan or if it's not configured properly, a good alternative is cpanm.  If you don't have cpanm, it's pretty easy to install:

  $ curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - --sudo App::cpanminus

Now install with cpanm:

  $ sudo cpanm App::AltSQL

Install User Space:
===================


If you don't have sudo access on the box you're working on, you can install altsql into your userspace fairly easily.  This involves using local::lib (http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?local%3A%3Alib).

NOTE: This is not recommended unless you're comfortable getting your hands a bit dirty.

Step 1: Install cpanm

  mkdir ~/bin
  cd ~/bin
  curl -LO http://xrl.us/cpanm
  chmod +x cpanm

Step 2: Install local::lib and setup your environment

  ~/bin/cpanm --local-lib=~/perl5 local::lib
  eval $(perl -I ~/perl5/lib/perl5/ -Mlocal::lib)

Step 3: Recreate this environment on future shells

  Bash:
  echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc

  C shell:
  perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib >> ~/.cshrc

Step 4: Install altsql

  ~/bin/cpanm App::AltSQL

Step 5: Run!

  altsql
